Building a simple system

This is a simple micro service that takes in an integer and tells the user whether it is an odd or even integer.

#Continuous integration and continuous deployment
In order to ensure continuous integration and delpoyment, we used git hub actions to automatically run all the service actions and trigger a continuous integration of the service whenever the code changes and deployment whenever the cloud based delivery of the service is triggered.

#Two cloud platforms were used to deploy the microservice;
AWS App runner
AWS EC2 integrated to cloud 9
