Building a simple system (Is odd or even?)

This is a simple micro service that takes in an integer and tells the user whether it is an odd or even integer.

i) Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD)

In order to ensure continuous integration and delpoyment, we used git hub actions to automatically run all the service actions and trigger a continuous integration of the service whenever the code changes and facilitate delivery for deployment whenever the cloud based service is triggered. A fast API was also built to facilitate CI/CD. 

ii) Two cloud platforms were used to deploy the microservice;
